Operation of the Password Generator Script:
Introduction with ASCII Art:

The script uses the pyfiglet library to display a stylized title ("Password Generator") at the start.
User Inputs:

The script prompts the user to enter 10 words. These words will serve as the base for generating passwords.
It then asks the user to specify the minimum and maximum lengths for the passwords. The script ensures these values are valid integers, with the maximum length being at least as long as the minimum length.
The user is prompted to provide a filename (ending with .txt) where the generated passwords will be saved. The script ensures the filename is valid and non-empty.
The script then asks for the number of passwords to generate, ensuring the input is a positive integer.
Password Generation:

For each password, the script randomly selects a word from the 10 user-provided words and converts it to leetspeak using a predefined translation table.
If the length of the leetspeak word is less than the desired password length, additional random characters (letters, digits, punctuation) are appended to meet the required length. If the leetspeak word is longer than the desired password length, it is truncated.
Saving Passwords:

The generated passwords are written to the specified file, with a header "Generated Passwords:" followed by the list of passwords.
Loop for Continuous Operation:

After generating and saving the passwords, the script asks the user if they want to generate more passwords. If the user enters "yes", the process repeats from the beginning. If the user enters "no", the script exits.
The script ensures valid responses ("yes" or "no") for the continuation prompt.
Error Handling:

The script includes error handling to ensure that all user inputs are valid. It prompts the user to re-enter information if invalid data is provided (e.g., non-integer values for lengths, empty words, etc.).
Summary:
This script is designed to interactively generate passwords based on user input, convert them to a leetspeak format, and save them to a specified file. It includes robust input validation and allows the user to generate multiple sets of passwords in a single session.
